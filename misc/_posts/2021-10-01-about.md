# Purpose
The goal of this website is to share the work of the Shmuylovich Lab. This will include finished manuscripts, side projects, protocols, 3D printing files, code snippets, etc. We intend to be active participants in the Open Science movement, and are happy to reduce barriers to the dissemination of our work.

# Inspiration

This site is [forked] from [D.Allan Drummond]'s lab website, which was inspired by [Trevor Bedford]'s [site] [1]. I'm very grateful for their efforts and their willingness to share. Our website's code is publically available on [Github] [2] and you can certainly copy/modify it if you like, but I'd recommend using the sources that we copied from instead!
