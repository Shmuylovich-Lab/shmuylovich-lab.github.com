The lab is just getting started, and we're eager to expand the team. We are looking for people interested in building new clinically useful and translatable imaging technology. We love to tinker and find clever open-source inexpensive ways to solve hardware challenges, but also have the resources to build cutting edge tools. If you have a passion for electronics, optics, imaging software, or just are super curious and want to build stuff, then please [reach out.](mailto:shmuylol@wustl.edu) When you do reach out, feel free to send examples of DIY projects that you're proud of! 

We are a lab that supports increasing representation of under-represented minorities in science and medicine, and encourage applicants of diverse backgrounds to join our team.
