# Abstract 

Background:
Free flap monitoring is more difficult in patients with dark skin because ischemia and congestion can be masked by pigmentation. For this reason, adjunct methods such as cutaneous near-infrared spectroscopy are of elevated importance in patients with highly pigmented skin. The purpose of this experiment is to determine if ViOpitx T.Ox performance is affected by cutaneous pigmentation.

Methods:
Swine with naturally occurring areas of nonpigmented and pigmented skin were used. Pigmentation of each animal was assessed using spectrophotometry and histopathology. During normoxemia, tissue oxygenation (StO2) measurements were taken of nonpigmented and pigmented skin using the T.Ox device. A bicolor pedicled rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap was raised, and T.Ox probe was adhered to adjacent areas of opposite coloration on the same flap. StO2 was measured continuously during reversible episodes of flap ischemia and congestion (n = 4 swine, n = 6 flaps).

Results:
There was not a significant difference between baseline StO2 values of nonpigmented (49% ± 7.9%) and pigmented skin (47% ± 6.2%). The absolute change in StO2 was significantly larger during both ischemia (6%) and congestion (16%) in nonpigmented skin compared with adjacent pigmented skin.

Conclusions:
T.Ox detects flap ischemia and congestion in both highly pigmented and nonpigmented skin. However, surgeons need to be aware that StO2 changes related to complete flap ischemia or congestion may be much more subtle than what is seen in nonpigmented skin. This study establishes a novel internally controlled porcine model that isolates the impact of skin pigmentation when assessing cutaneous devices measuring tissue oxygenation.
