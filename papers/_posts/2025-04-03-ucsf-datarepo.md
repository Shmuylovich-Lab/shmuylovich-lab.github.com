# Abstract

The OpenOximetry Dataset stores clinical and lab pulse oximetry data. It supports measurements of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO₂) by arterial blood gas co-oximetry and pulse oximetry (SpO₂), alongside processed and unprocessed photoplethysmography (PPG) data and other metadata. This includes skin pigmentation, sensor type, and patient demographics. The accompanying common data model enables structured comparisons across devices and studies, facilitating improvements in oximeter accuracy and equity in global health settings.
