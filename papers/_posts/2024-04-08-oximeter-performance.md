# Abstract 

**Background**  
Fingertip pulse oximeters are widely available, inexpensive, and commonly used to make clinical decisions in many settings. Device performance is largely unregulated and poorly characterised, especially in people with dark skin pigmentation.

**Methods**  
Eleven popular fingertip pulse oximeters were evaluated using the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance (2013) and International Organization for Standardization Standards (ISO, 2017) in 34 healthy humans with diverse skin pigmentation utilising a controlled desaturation study with arterial oxygen saturation (SaOâ‚‚) plateaus between 70% and 100%. Skin pigmentation was assessed subjectively using a perceived Fitzpatrick Scale (pFP) and objectively using the individual typology angle (ITA) via spectrophotometry at nine anatomical sites.

**Findings**  
Five of 11 devices had a root mean square error (ARMS) > 3%, falling outside the acceptable FDA performance range. Nine devices demonstrated worse performance in participants in the darkest skin pigmentation category compared with those in the lightest category. A commonly used subjective skin colour scale frequently miscategorised participants as being darkly pigmented when compared to objective quantification of skin pigment by ITA.

**Interpretation**  
Fingertip pulse oximeters have variable performance, frequently not meeting regulatory requirements for clinical use, and occasionally contradicting claims made by manufacturers. Most devices showed a trend toward worse performance in participants with darker skin pigment. Regulatory standards do not adequately account for the impact of skin pigmentation on device performance. We recommend that the pFP and other non-standardised subjective skin colour scales should no longer be used for defining diversity of skin pigmentation. Reliable methods for characterising skin pigmentation to improve diversity and equitable performance of pulse oximeters are needed.
