In 2003 I enrolled as an MD/PhD student in the Medical Scientist Training Program at Washington University in Saint Louis with the goal of becoming a physician scientist. Now after a little more than 18 years of training and some detours, I am thrilled to launch the website for my independent research lab.

I love to tinker in software and hardware, and I'm excited to have the chance to continue putting my creative efforts towards the betterment of human health. I'm looking forward to recruiting a diverse and passionate team of scientists and trainees that can make a significant impact in the lives of others.

In the next few months I hope to add more details about ongoing research projects, for now though the site will be a bit barren.

The site is fully open source, available in a [GitHub repository][1].
