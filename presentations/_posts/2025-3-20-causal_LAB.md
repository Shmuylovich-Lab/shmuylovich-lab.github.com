# Abstract

Assessment of skin color by colorimetry can objectively measure skin-disease progression and help ensure that clinical trials recruit diverse populations. Colorimeters report color in the three-dimensional L\*a\*b\* space (L\* = lightness/darkness, a\* = green/redness, b\* = blue/yellowness). Empirical studies have shown that (1) human skin L\*, a\*, b\* values cluster in a banana-shaped region of this space and (2) the angle between the point (L\* = 50, b\* = 0) and an individual’s (L\*, b\*) coordinates—the Individual Typology Angle (ITA)—can act as a melanin surrogate.  

We sought to establish a causal link between cutaneous chromophore concentrations and L\*a\*b\* values. Using a three-layer skin model and the adding-doubling method, we varied melanosome fraction (M<sub>frac</sub>, 0–43 %) and blood-volume fraction (B<sub>frac</sub>, 0.2–7 %) to generate diffuse-reflectance spectra that were subsequently converted to L\*a\*b\*. At constant M<sub>frac</sub>, varying B<sub>frac</sub> produced distinct, non-overlapping iso-melanin curves that reproduced the empirical banana and its boundaries in the L\*–b\* plane. These curves furnish a theoretical basis for the ITA–melanin relationship while revealing that ITA is unreliable when B<sub>frac</sub> is low.  

The results show how simple colorimeter readings can provide quantitative insight into underlying melanin and hemoglobin, offering a path toward improved non-invasive assessment of skin chromophores.
