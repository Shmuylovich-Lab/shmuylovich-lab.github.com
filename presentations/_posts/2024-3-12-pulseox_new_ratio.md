# Abstract

Pulse oximeters are widely used in healthcare systems to estimate blood oxygen saturation level (SpO₂) using red and infrared light. Recent clinical and simulation studies reported that in darkly pigmented subjects, oximeters overestimate SpO₂, potentially leading to higher rates of occult hypoxemia in these populations. Solutions to this issue include redesigning the oximeter, modifying calibration cohorts, or adjusting the oximeter ratio (R).

In this study, a new formulation of the oximeter ratio was proposed using alternate combinations of oximeter parameters. Simulations showed that
