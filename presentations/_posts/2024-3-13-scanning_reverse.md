# Abstract

Low-cost slide scanners, in conjunction with remote reading and AI-powered diagnostic workflows, have been proposed to democratize digital slide scanning for histopathologic diagnosis. However, scan speed is limited because proposed systems scan only one slide at a time.  

We developed a high-speed, low-cost, multicamera slide scanning system using a 3D printer and a Raspberry Pi with 4 motorized focus cameras. Motorized focus results in an adjustable working distance, which allows for multi-camera fine-tuning of the focus plane without additional delay to adjust the z-position.  

By supporting parallel acquisition of 4 cameras at once at a fixed z-position, scanning speed increases fourfold.
