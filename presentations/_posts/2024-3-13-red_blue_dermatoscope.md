# Abstract

Nonmelanoma skin cancer is the most common malignancy in the US, and while Mohs microsurgery is curative in the majority of cases, inaccurate presurgical visual estimation of tumor margins leads to the need for more than one stage in 30% of cases. Dual wavelength optical polarization imaging (OPI) provides accurate presurgical delineation of tumor margins, but existing OPI devices are not easily translated to the dermatology clinical setting. We found that the clinically ubiquitous dermatascope can be repurposed as a handheld OPI system that has functionality on par with existing OPI devices at a fraction of the cost.
